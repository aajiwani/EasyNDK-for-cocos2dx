EasyNDK-for-cocos2dx (By TheArsenik)
====================

This repository is a fork of the original project initiated by aajiwani (https://github.com/aajiwani/EasyNDK-for-cocos2dx).

I started to modify this framework because I was wondering EasyNDK was working Cocos2d-x nodes instead of objects (of course "CCObject" because they simplify memory management regarding C++ mecanisms).

I improved the original project and I'm planning to adapt it to Cocos2d-X 3 (you can see a branch which is under developement).

I will explain more my thoughts when I will have more time but keep this project starred!
